# Cloud Computing Risk Analysis API

This repository contains the code for a cloud-native API that performs risk analysis on trading strategies using Monte Carlo simulations. The system is built using multiple cloud platforms to provide scalability, serverless architecture, and ease of deployment.

## Abstract

This project involves the development and deployment of a risk analysis API that leverages the power of cloud computing. The API is hosted on **Google App Engine (GAE)**, with **AWS Lambda** handling serverless functions, and **Amazon EC2** providing scalable computational resources. The system aligns with the **NIST SP 800-145** guidelines for cloud computing, and the report submitted along with this codebase discusses the impact on both the developer and user experience. 

Key results include:
- **Risk analysis** using Monte Carlo simulations
- **Performance metrics** of the cloud architecture
- **Cost analysis** of the cloud services

## Repository Structure

The repository contains four Python (`.py`) files, each designed to serve different components of the system:
- **AWS Lambda Functions**: For executing serverless tasks related to risk analysis.
- **GAE Deployment**: Code for hosting and serving the API.
- **EC2 Scripts**: Scripts for handling larger computational tasks via EC2 instances.
